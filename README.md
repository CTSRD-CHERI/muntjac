# Muntjac

Muntjac is a minimal 64-bit RISC-V multicore processor that's easy to understand, verify, and extend. The focus is on having a clean, well-tested design which others can build upon and further customise. Performance is secondary to correctness, but the aim is to work towards a design point (considering power, performance and area) that maximises the value of Muntjac as a baseline design for educational, academic, or real-world use.

Muntjac is currently a work in progress and is supported on a best-effort basis.

Documentation is available [here](doc/README.md) and build instructions are [here](./flows).
