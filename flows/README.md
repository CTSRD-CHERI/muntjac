# Muntjac synthesis flows

Muntjac supports the following synthesis flows:

 * Verilator (software)
 * Vivado (FPGA)
 * ~~OpenROAD (ASIC, free)~~
 * ~~Synopsys (ASIC, commercial)~~

This directory contains scripts and other auxiliary files required to exercise these tools, and also [`.core` files](https://fusesoc.readthedocs.io/en/master/ref/capi2.html), which determine which source files and arguments are required for each build.
