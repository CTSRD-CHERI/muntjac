This directory contains a collection of basic tools which allow other programs to properly interact with Muntjac and the wider system, without the need for a full operating system.

Examples include:
 * Access to control registers and performance counters

Other low-level features (system calls, initialisation, linker script) have now been ported into the [baremetal toolchain](https://github.com/db434/newlib-muntjac-baremetal).
