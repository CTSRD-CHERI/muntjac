This directory contains a collection of basic tools which allow other programs to properly interact with Muntjac and the wider system, without the need for a full operating system.

Examples include:
 * Access to control registers and performance counters
 * System calls
 * crt0, used to perform initialisation before a program begins
 * Linker script to ensure I/O signals are not cached

See [hello_world](../hello_world) for an example of how to use these tools.
